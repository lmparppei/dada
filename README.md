## Digital cut-up tool

Simple tool for creating cut-up poetry. Wanted to try out this classic method of dadaists one rainy Thursday, but my typewriter broke down and I had no paper or printer at my disposal. So I did it on a computer.

Uses jQuery (unfortunately), jQuery UI Sortable and touchpunch.

I am not really a programmer, all apologies for my code.
